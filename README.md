# Project Description

####  This project provides a ticket and user management system with three roles: Administrator, Moderator, and User, each with distinct functions and permissions.

## Administrator

The Administrator has access to an advanced management panel that allows:
- Managing users and moderators.
- Viewing reports, including categories, topics, brief descriptions, creation dates, last correspondence dates, and status.
- Accessing correspondence between users and moderators regarding user reports.
- Displaying statistics, such as the number of reports handled by moderators, the number of reports assigned to the administrator, and the number of clients added to the database.
- Adding new clients to the database, allowing them to register in the system.

## Moderator

The Moderator has access to a panel that allows:
- Viewing user data.
- Adding clients to the database, similar to the administrator.
- Reviewing and responding to pending reports, as well as assigning them individually.

## User
A User can register in the system after their PESEL number has been added by an administrator. During registration, the user completes their details, such as first name, last name, and PESEL number, which were initially entered by the administration.

After logging into the system, the user can:
- Create reports assigned to appropriate categories.
- View their reports, including the date, time, and status of the report.

## Additional Features
**Responsive Design:** The system is visually responsive, adapting seamlessly to all devices, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.

**Theme Selection:** Users can choose between a light or dark theme, providing a customizable viewing experience.
